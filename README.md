## AntColony Optimization for TSP, implement in [Netlogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/)

 1. Initialize: Create Breed (ant, request), Agents and Parameters (e.g. Number of Agents, Pheromone list)

 2. Set the behavior of agents (ant keep moving to unvisited point with probability related to Distance and Pheromone)

 3. Set the rule of Pheromone stayed

 4. Keep itering and find the better solutions
